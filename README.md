# My CS Journey

Welcome to my learning station.

## Purpose

This repository is where I document everything I learn in the vast world of Computer Science.
My goal is to gradually build a collection of notes, mind maps, and presentations that I can reference over time as my knowledge grows. And hey, why not share it with the world since im already hosting it on the cloud.

## Why I'm Doing This

- Right now, I often feel overwhelmed by how much there is to learn. 
- By building a list of information I've gathered and verified, I can stop wasting time. 
- This space will serve as both a record of my progress and a grounding guide for the future. 
- I am tired of being barraged by every media front to be conditioned that AI is superior to us. 
- I need to prove to myself that I have not become a robot myself. 

## What's Inside (Eventually)

-  **Notes** – Quick references, commands, concepts.
-  **Mind Maps** – Visual overviews of complex topics.
-  **Presentations** – Deep dives into subjects I’ve explored.
-  **Tools & Resources** – Things I find useful along the way.

## Considerations
This is a DIY, ongoing process. It won’t be perfect, but it will be mine. \
I AM allergic to bullshit. \
I have extremely negative feelings towards subscription based services, as well as proprietary software. \
There is just way too many examples that have come to light regarding privacy breaching and Terms of Service obfuscation.
How can we put trust in code that the public doesnt have access to verify? \
I believe consumers should have the right to repair broken electronic components without depending on the company solely.
